Contact Keeper is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their personal contacts securely. It provides a clean, responsive interface for authenticated users to register, log in, and manage contacts (create, view, edit, delete). Each user's contacts are private, ensuring data isolation. The app features JWT-based authentication, a modern UI with Tailwind CSS, and toast-style alerts for user feedback.
